<p class="story">Mississippi officials arrested suspect <a href="https://governorreeves.ms.gov/arson-investigation-at-beth-israel-congregation-in-jackson-mississippi/"> Stephen Spencer Pittman</a> Saturday and charged him with arson after a fire was set early that morning at Beth Israel, Jackson’s only synagogue.</p>

<p class="story">The 19-year-old was taken into custody Saturday evening at a nearby hospital, where he was being treated for non-life-threatening burns, according to officials.</p>

<p class="story">The fire broke out around <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/11/us/mississippi-synagogue-arson-attack-suspect.html"> 3 a.m.</a> No injuries were reported.</p>

<p class="story">Officials said the fire caused extensive damage to the building, including:</p>

<!-- list -->
<ul>
<li>The synagogue library, where two Torahs were destroyed</li>
<li>Significant smoke damage throughout the building</li>
<li>The main sanctuary, where five Torahs were damaged</li>
</ul> 

<p class="story">Beth Israel has previously been targeted. Decades ago, the synagogue was bombed by the Ku Klux Klan while the congregation was advocating for racial integration.</p>

<p>Congregation President Zach Shemper said rebuilding could take between <a href="https://forward.com/fast-forward/800133/beth-israel-zach-shemper-jackson-buchdahl/"> one and a half and three years.</a> In the meantime, several Jackson houses of worship, including Northminster Baptist Church, have offered space for services.</p>

<p>Congregation leaders said they expect to resume services as early as next week and will continue sharing <a href="https://www.bethisraelms.org/rebuilding-updates"> updates</a> during the rebuilding process.</p>
